In this scope, we derive surrogate functions for various standard objectives that can then be used as building blocks, with examples for robust learning costs and sparsity enforcing penalties. To illustrate this point, we propose a new set of algorithms for sparse PCA driven by this methodology, whose objective function is composed of an M-estimation type subspace fitting term plus a regularizer that promotes sparsity. Simulations and experiments on real data illustrate the interest of the proposed approach, both in terms of performance and computational complexity.","tags":[],"title":"Majorization-Minimization on the Stiefel Manifold With Application to Robust Sparse PCA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florent Bouchard","Arnaud Breloy","Guillaume Ginolhac","Alexandre Renaux","Fr√©d√©ric Pascal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"1ebc0517fdb07ad2eee7ecffd242f72b","permalink":"https://abreloy.github.io/publication/j14_tsp21b/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j14_tsp21b/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes an original Riemmanian geometry for low-rank structured elliptical models, i.e., when samples are elliptically distributed with a covariance matrix that has a low-rank plus identity structure.

One of the main contribution is to consider an original Riemannian metric, leading to new representations of tangent spaces and geodesics. From this geometry, we derive a new Riemannian optimization framework for robust covariance estimation, which is leveraged to minimize the popular Tyler's cost function on the considered quotient manifold. We also obtain a new divergence function, which is exploited to define a geometrical error measure on the quotient, and the corresponding intrinsic Cram√©r-Rao lower bound is derived. Thanks to the structure of the chosen parametrization, we further consider the subspace estimation error on the Grassmann manifold and provide its intrinsic Cram√©r-Rao lower bound.

For matrix- and array-valued data, e.g., MIMO communication, EEG/MEG (time versus channel), the covariance matrix of vectorized data may belong to the non-convex set of Kronecker product structure. In addition, the Kronecker factors can also exhibit an additional linear structure. Taking this prior knowledge into account during the estimation process drastically reduces the amount of unknown parameters, and then improves the estimation accuracy. On the other hand, the broad class of complex elliptically symmetric distributions, as well as the related complex angular elliptical distribution, are particularly suited to model heavy-tailed multivariate data. In this context, we first establish novel robust estimators of scatter and shape matrices (both related to a covariance matrix), having a Kronecker product structure with linearly structured Kronecker factors. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic performance (i.e., consistency, asymptotic distribution and efficiency), in matched and mismatched scenarios, i.e., when misspecifications between the true and assumed models occur. Finally, numerical results illustrate the theoretical analysis and assess the usefulness of the proposed estimators.","tags":[],"title":"Matched and Mismatched Estimation of Kronecker Product of Linearly Structured Scatter Matrices Under Elliptical Distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnaud Breloy","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

Classical statistical change detection methodologies based on covariance matrix analysis are usually built upon the Gaussian assumption, as well as an unstructured signal model.

Consequently, these classical estimation methods are no longer suitable, and the use of non-Gaussian noise model is necessary. In this paper, we therefore treat the DOA estimation problem in a non-Gaussian framework based on the maximum likelihood approach using a compound-Gaussian (CG) noise model. We then propose the use of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to reduce the computational cost of the proposed algorithm.

When the noise distribution turns to be non-Gaussian, the detectors relying on the Sample Covariance Matrix (SCM) can perform poorly and an interesting alternative is the use of M-estimators. In this context, we show that, from Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) samples, the distribution of a detection statistic built with M-estimators can be accurately approximated by the one of the same statistic built from the SCM of an equivalent Gaussian setting. The loss due to this approximation is theoretically derived and shown to be negligible in most cases. This explicit equivalent statistic is especially interesting since it allows to tune robust plug-in detectors with well established results from the Gaussian detection framework.

The LR clutter is modeled by a spherically invariant random vector with assumed high clutter-to-noise ratio. In such a context, adaptive process should require less training samples than classical methods to reach equivalent performance as in a ‚Äúfull rank‚Äù clutter configuration. The main issue is that classical robust estimators of the CM cannot be computed in the undersampled configuration. To overcome this issue, the current approach is based on regularization methods. Nevertheless, most of these solutions are enforcing the estimate to be well conditioned, while in our context, it should be LR structured. This paper, therefore, addresses this issue and derives an algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator of the CM for the considered disturbance model. Several relaxations and robust generalizations of the result are discussed. Performance is finally illustrated on numerical simulations and on a space time adaptive processing for airborne radar application.","tags":[],"title":"Robust Covariance Matrix Estimation in Heterogeneous Low Rank Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In such a context, adaptive processing based on an estimated orthogonal projector onto the clutter subspace (instead of an estimated covariance matrix) requires less samples than classical methods. The clutter subspace estimate is usually derived from the eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix estimate. However, it has been previously shown that a direct Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the clutter subspace projector can be obtained for the considered context. In this paper, we derive two algorithms based on the block majorization-minimization framework to reach this estimator. These algorithms are shown to be computationally faster than the state of the art, with guaranteed convergence. Finally, the performance of the related estimators is illustrated on realistic Space Time Adaptive Processing for airborne radar simulations.","tags":[],"title":"Low-Complexity Algorithms for Low Rank Clutter Parameters Estimation in Radar Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnaud Breloy","Guillaume Ginolhac","Fr√©d√©ric Pascal","Philippe Forster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1422748800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1422748800,"objectID":"2f37b7dd0c734f2d5d6953e9aa6b67a1","permalink":"https://abreloy.github.io/publication/j1_tsp15/","publishdate":"2015-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j1_tsp15/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the problem of the Clutter Subspace Projector (CSP) estimation in the context of a disturbance composed of a Low Rank (LR) heterogeneous clutter, modeled here by a Spherically Invariant Random Vector (SIRV), plus a white Gaussian noise (WGN). In such context, the corresponding LR adaptive filters and detectors require less training vectors than classical methods to reach equivalent performance. Unlike classical adaptive processes, which are based on an estimate of the noise Covariance Matrix (CM), the LR processes are based on a CSP estimate. This CSP estimate is usually derived from a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the CM estimate. However, no Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) of the CM has been derived for the considered disturbance model. In this paper, we introduce the fixed point equation that MLE of the CSP satisfies for a disturbance composed of a LR-SIRV clutter plus a zero mean WGN. A recursive algorithm is proposed to compute this solution. Numerical simulations validate the introduced estimator and illustrate its interest compared to the current state of art.","tags":[],"title":"Clutter Subspace Estimation in Low Rank Heterogeneous Noise Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnaud Breloy","bbbbbbbbb Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
