While these models can be both linked to structures exhibited by covariance and precision matrices, they are generally not jointly leveraged within graph learning processes. This paper therefore addresses this issue by proposing a flexible algorithmic framework for graph learning under low-rank structural constraints on the covariance matrix. The problem is expressed as penalized maximum likelihood estimation of an elliptical distribution (a generalization of Gaussian graphical models to possibly heavy-tailed distributions), where the covariance matrix is optionally constrained to be structured as low-rank plus diagonal (low-rank factor model). The resolution of this class of problems is then tackled with Riemannian optimization, where we leverage geometries of positive definite matrices and positive semi-definite matrices of fixed rank that are well suited to elliptical models.

Calibration of such instruments is necessary and is a critical task. This is how the estimation of instrumental errors is usually done thanks to the knowledge of referenced celestial sources. However, the use of high sensitive antennas in modern radio interferometers (LOFAR, SKA) brings a new challenge in radio astronomy because they are more sensitive to Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI). The presence of RFI during the calibration process generally induces biases in state-of-the-art solutions. The purpose of this paper is to propose an alternative to alleviate the effects of RFI. For that, we first propose a model to take into account the presence of RFI in the data across multiple frequency channels thanks to a low-rank structured noise. We then achieve maximum likelihood estimation of the calibration parameters with a Space Alternating Generalized Expectation-Maximization (SAGE) algorithm for which we derive originally two sets of complete data allowing closed-form expressions for the updates.

For matrix- and array-valued data, e.g., MIMO communication, EEG/MEG (time versus channel), the covariance matrix of vectorized data may belong to the non-convex set of Kronecker product structure. In addition, the Kronecker factors can also exhibit an additional linear structure. Taking this prior knowledge into account during the estimation process drastically reduces the amount of unknown parameters, and then improves the estimation accuracy. On the other hand, the broad class of complex elliptically symmetric distributions, as well as the related complex angular elliptical distribution, are particularly suited to model heavy-tailed multivariate data. In this context, we first establish novel robust estimators of scatter and shape matrices (both related to a covariance matrix), having a Kronecker product structure with linearly structured Kronecker factors. Then, we conduct a theoretical analysis of their asymptotic performance (i.e., consistency, asymptotic distribution and efficiency), in matched and mismatched scenarios, i.e., when misspecifications between the true and assumed models occur.

Consequently, these classical estimation methods are no longer suitable, and the use of non-Gaussian noise model is necessary. In this paper, we therefore treat the DOA estimation problem in a non-Gaussian framework based on the maximum likelihood approach using a compound-Gaussian (CG) noise model.

The Fisher Information Metric and its associated Riemannian distance (namely, CES-Fisher) on the manifold of Hermitian positive definite matrices are derived. Based on these results, intrinsic Cramér-Rao bounds on the considered problems are then expressed for three different distances (Euclidean, natural Riemannian, and CES-Fisher). These contributions are therefore a generalization of Theorems 4 and 5 of [1] to a wider class of distributions and metrics for both scatter and shape matrices.","tags":[],"title":"Intrinsic Cramér–Rao bounds for scatter and shape matrices estimation in CES distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Mériaux","Chengfang Ren","Mohammed Nabil El Korso","Arnaud Breloy","Philippe Forster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"33caf8b658b861924faa23bea5d7701e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/j5_spl19b/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j5_spl19b/","section":"publication","summary":"The joint estimation of means and scatter matrices is often a core problem in multivariate analysis.

Traditionally, statistical adaptive detection processes are built from a binary hypothesis test performing on a grid of steering vectors. This usually involves the estimation of the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix using i.i.d. samples assumed to be target-free. Moving from this paradigm, we exploit the fact that the interference (clutter and/or jammers) lies in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Hence, the matrix of concatenated samples can be modeled as a sum of low-rank matrices (union of subspaces containing interferences) plus a sparse matrix times a dictionary of steering-vectors (rep-resenting the targets contribution). Recovering this factorization from the observation matrix allows to build detection maps for each sample. To perform such recovery, we propose a generalized version of the robust subspace recovery via bi-sparsity pursuit algorithm [1]. Experimental results on a real data set highlight the interest of the approach.","tags":[],"title":"Robust Subspace Clustering for Radar Detection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bruno Meriaux","Chengfang Ren","Mohammed Nabil El Korso","Arnaud Breloy","Philippe Forster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"c6ed37d1e4222d55177df8c6e4a584c0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/c13_camsap17/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/c13_camsap17/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper deals with structured covariance matrix estimation in a robust statistical framework. Covariance matrices often exhibit a particular structure related to the application of interest and taking this structure into account increases estimation accuracy. Within the framework of robust estimation, the class of circular Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) distributions is particularly interesting to handle impulsive and spiky data. Normalized CES random vectors are known to share a common Complex Angular Elliptical distribution. In this context, we propose a Robust Covariance Matrix Estimation Technique (RCOMET) based on Tyler's estimate and COMET criterion for convexly structured matrices. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically efficient while computationally attractive.

Developing adaptive methods for the selection of the regularisation parameter α is currently an active topic of research. Indeed, the bias-performance compromise of RTEs highly depends on the considered application. Thus, finding a generic rule that is optimal for every criterion and/or data configurations is not straightforward. This issue is addressed in this paper for undersampled configurations (number of samples lower than the dimension of the data). The paper proposes a new regularisation parameter selection based on a subspace reduction approach. The performance of this method is investigated in terms of estimation accuracy and for adaptive detection purposes, both on simulation and real data.","tags":[],"title":"A subspace approach for shrinkage parameter selection in undersampled configuration for Regularised Tyler Estimators","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnaud Breloy","Guillaume Ginolhac","Frédéric Pascal","Philippe Forster"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1470009600,"objectID":"180fec8b606d9b1a2a8ac5d6d9763a9e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/j3_tsp16b/","publishdate":"2016-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/j3_tsp16b/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the problem of robust covariance matrix (CM) estimation in the context of a disturbance composed of a low rank (LR) heterogeneous clutter plus an additive white Gaussian noise. The LR clutter is modeled by a spherically invariant random vector with assumed high clutter-to-noise ratio. In such a context, adaptive process should require less training samples than classical methods to reach equivalent performance as in a “full rank” clutter configuration. The main issue is that classical robust estimators of the CM cannot be computed in the undersampled configuration. To overcome this issue, the current approach is based on regularization methods. Nevertheless, most of these solutions are enforcing the estimate to be well conditioned, while in our context, it should be LR structured. This paper, therefore, addresses this issue and derives an algorithm to compute the maximum likelihood estimator of the CM for the considered disturbance model. Several relaxations and robust generalizations of the result are discussed. Performance is finally illustrated on numerical simulations and on a space time adaptive processing for airborne radar application.","tags":[],"title":"Robust covariance matrix estimation in heterogeneous low rank context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arnaud Breloy","Ying Sun","Prabhu Babu","Guillaume Ginolhac","Daniel P.
