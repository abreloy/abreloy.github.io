abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new estimator of the covariance matrix parameters when observations follow a mixture of a deterministic Compound-Gaussian (CG) and a white Gaussian noise. In particular, the covariance matrix of the CG contribution is assumed to be expressed as the Kronecker product of two low-rank matrices, which is a structure often involved in MIMO array processing. The proposed estimator is then obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the data with the use of a specifically tailored block Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm. Finally, the method is evaluated in terms of adaptive filtering on a MIMO-STAP radar setting, showing important improvements over standard processing.}
